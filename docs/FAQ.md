### How do I prevent dependency conflicts between my tap and target?
To prevent conflicts, we recommend running taps and targets in separate [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). That helps isolate the dependencies for each.  See instructions for doing this [here](RUNNING_AND_DEVELOPING.md#running-a-singer-tap-with-a-singer-target).
